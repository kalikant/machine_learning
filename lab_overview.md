### Objectives: 

- Understand the broad classifications of data: quantitative vs qualitative. 
- Understand the core statistics that underpin all data analysis 
- Understand inferential and differential statistics and how they apply to data analysis.
- Apply univariate and multivariate analysis to financial data sets
- Demonstrate the ability to profile data (inspecting rows of data, and reading data sets)
- Detect and remediate missing, miscoded and anomalous data.
- Understand regression analysis.
- Understand how numerical python and panel data can be used in big data analytics
- Introduce the basics of the Pandas Series object and DataFrame
- Develop simple summaries and exploratory graphs that optimize data visualization at various stages of data analysis
- Explain how the fundamental variation of graphs and corresponding quantitative relationships can be paired with optimal visual components and techniques
- Introduce a brief capstone project that utilizes several data analysis techniques
